## Connectivity
- Single-pair connectivity:
  - Breadth First Search (BFS)
  - Depth First Search (DFS)
- Strongly connected components:
  - Tarjan's algorithm
  
## Traversal
- To-Do

## Topological sort
- Kahn's algorithm
- Depth First Search (DFS)

## Shortest path
- Single-pair shortest path problem:
  - A* search algorithm: heuristics to try to speed up the search.
- Single-source shortest path problem (equivalently, single-destination shortest path problem): 
  - Dijkstra's algorithm: non-negative edge weight
  - Bellman-Ford algorithm: edge weights may be negative
- All-pairs shortest path problem:
  - Floydâ€“Warshall algorithm
  - Johnson's algorithm: faster than Floyd-Warshall for sparse graphs
- Shortest stochastic path problem:
  - Viterbi algorithm
