Tools/algorithms/libraries/references for encoding/decoding, hashing, obfuscation, IDs construction, encryption, etc.
## Text encoding
- [The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets (No Excuses!)](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/): Joel's rant on programmers' knowledge about encoding, good introductory text to ASCII (and related encodings), Unicode (UTF-8, UTF-16, etc.) including an explanation on what the BOM is for.
- [Introduction to Character Encoding](https://itnext.io/introduction-to-character-encoding-3b9735f265a6): from binary base to Unicode (includes explanation of BOM).

## Hashes
- ...

## IDs
- [UUIDs, universally unique identifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier). Example: `b4162471-7381-4b1f-a129-2fa9bbb29820`
- [Hashids](https://hashids.org/), custom-alphabet reversible short unique alphanumeric IDs from integers lists. Example: `GlaHquq0`
- [Nano ID](https://github.com/ai/nanoid), custom-alphabet fast size-limited random IDs. Example `0iIOnjH-5N7QQBzsMgAW8`
