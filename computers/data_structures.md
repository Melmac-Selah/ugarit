# Data structures
- Miscelaneous
  - [collections](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html) 
  - [SortedCollections](http://www.grantjenks.com/docs/sortedcollections/):  
    - ValueSortedDict: Dictionary with (key, value) item pairs sorted by value.
    - ItemSortedDict: Dictionary with key-function support for item pairs.  
    - OrderedDict: Ordered dictionary with numeric indexing support.
    - OrderedSet: Ordered set with numeric indexing support.
    - IndexableDict: Dictionary with numeric indexing support.
    - IndexableSet: Set with numeric indexing support.
    - SegmentList: List with fast random access insertion and deletion.
  - [SortedContainers](http://www.grantjenks.com/docs/sortedcontainers):
    - Sorted List
    - Sorted Dict
    - Sorted Set
- [Trie (or prefixed tree)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie)
  - [pygtrie](https://github.com/google/pygtrie)
- [SetTrie](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01506780/document)
  - [PySettrie](https://github.com/mmihaltz/pysettrie): Python implementation of the following
    - SetTrie: set-trie container for sets; supports efficient supersets/subsets of a given search set calculations.
    - SetTrieMap: mapping container using sets as keys; supports efficient operations like SetTrie but also stores values associated to the key sets.
    - SetTrieMultiMap: like SetTrieMap, but supports multiple values associated to each key.
- [Binary Decision Diagram (BDD)](): directed acyclic graph used to represent a Boolean function
  - [pyEDA/BDDs](https://pyeda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bdd.html)
