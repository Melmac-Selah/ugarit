## Relationships
- AUC & Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U-Statistic:
  - [AUC Meets the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U-Statistic by Bob Horton, Senior Data Scientist, Microsoft](https://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2017/03/auc-meets-u-stat.html), includes probabilistic explanation of AUC at the end
- AUC distribution with error rate:
  - [AUC Optimization vs. Error Rate Minimization by Corinna Cortes and Mehryar Mohri](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2518-auc-optimization-vs-error-rate-minimization.pdf), shows also the relationship with the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U-Statistic
