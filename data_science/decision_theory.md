# Decision theory
- [Lecture 2: Frequentist and Bayesian Decision-Making - DS 102 Data, Inference, and Decisions Spring 2020](https://data102.org/sp20/assets/notes/notes02.pdf): good intuitive introduction explaining the relationship between the Bayesian and frequentist paradigm also including the mathematics behind
- [CS540 Machine learning Lecture 11 Decision theory, model selection](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/Teaching/CS540-Fall08/L11.pdf): relationship between decision theory and model selection (nice distinction between model and algorithm)
